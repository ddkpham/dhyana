# Dhyana Project Management Software

Project management software and collaboration tool. Helps organize and 
structure project planning to maximize success. Teams can create multiple
projects and manage them all in one single simple interface. 

Steps to demo / features implemented:

1. Sign up

    - create a dhyana user by clicking sign up on the login page
    - fill in required information. (first and last name are optional)

2. Login 
3. Home page / project view 
    - displays list of projects

    Currently, there is no page to create teams. Each project should be 
    assigned to a single team. Every team may manage multiple projects. 
    For convenience we've included a set of teams to choose when creating 
    projects. 
    
    In addition, all projects are shown in this view currently. Next 
    step would be to filter projects to people who are in teams assigned
    to a project. 
    
4. User search

    - In the app bar, there is a search icon. This takes you to the 
    search user page. In the future iteration, you will be able to 
    add a team and members to that team. This will be the page where
    you can search for users signed up for the application. 
    
5. Create a project board

    menu button. This should take you back to projects view.
